/**
 * Split a `.repx` into the units a house-style example is made of.
 *
 * Milestone 1 of `docs/proposals/rag.md`, and the only part of that proposal that
 * earns its place whether or not the rest is ever built: a structural chunker with
 * the data stripped out is useful for diffing two reports and for explaining an
 * audit finding, neither of which needs an embedding.
 *
 * ## Why the split is structural and not by length
 *
 * The obvious chunker cuts every N characters. A `.repx` is a tree, and cutting it
 * by length severs a control from the band that positions it: the fragment keeps
 * `LocationFloat="0,240"` and loses the fact that 240 is measured inside a page
 * footer. What comes back from a search is then a coordinate with no frame of
 * reference, which is worse than no result because it reads like an answer.
 *
 * So the unit is the band, and the control directly inside it. Those are the two
 * grains a person means by "our reports look like this" — how a footer is laid out,
 * and how a total is styled.
 *
 * ## Nested things ride with their parent, deliberately
 *
 * A control is chunked only when its nearest `ControlType`-bearing ancestor is a
 * band. Anything deeper — the labels inside an `XRPanel`, the cells inside an
 * `XRTable` — stays part of that parent's fragment instead of becoming a chunk of
 * its own. Emitting both would return the same XML twice for one query and spend
 * the retrieval budget saying one thing.
 *
 * **Do not reach for the rule that a collection item carries no `ControlType`.**
 * That holds for chart series and is measured in `docs/notes/gemini.md`; it does
 * not hold here. In `rptWorkerLedger_DJ.repx` all 47 `XRTableCell` elements carry
 * one, `Text` and all. They stay out of the chunk list because of the nesting rule
 * above and for no other reason, which is worth knowing before anyone "simplifies"
 * that rule away.
 *
 * Bands nest too — a `SubBand` inside a `DetailBand` — and the same rule applies
 * upward: **the chunkable band is the outermost one**, and a control anywhere
 * inside it is attributed to that band however many sub-bands sit in between. The
 * first version attributed to the *nearest* band, and against a real report that
 * produced nine bands captioned `empty` with all 44 controls filed under `sub
 * band`, which is both wrong and useless: "in the sub band" locates nothing.
 *
 * ## Everything that is data is replaced before it is stored
 *
 * `REDACTIONS` lists the attributes whose values are content rather than style, and
 * each is replaced with a placeholder as the fragment is cut. Three reasons, in
 * descending order of how badly it goes wrong:
 *
 * 1. **A model given an example copies it.** A retrieved fragment carrying
 *    `Text="Acme Ltd"` is one plausible step from an invoice generated for somebody
 *    else with Acme's name on it. The whole feature is an argument for putting other
 *    people's reports into a prompt, so this is the failure it has to answer for.
 * 2. **`Ref` is identity, and duplicating it destroys content.** Two controls
 *    sharing a `Ref` make the DevExpress loader discard one with no error — the
 *    defect recorded in `docs/notes/gemini.md`. An example fragment that keeps its
 *    original `Ref` is an invitation to copy it into a document that already has
 *    one. Redacting it costs nothing, because a number identifying a control in
 *    another file cannot mean anything in this one.
 * 3. Field names are schema, not style, and they are the part of a report most
 *    likely to be commercially specific.
 *
 * Geometry, fonts, colours, borders, alignment and format strings are all **kept**.
 * `TextFormatString` in particular is style rather than content — `{0:c2}` is a
 * decision about how money is shown, which is exactly what this is for.
 *
 * **The residual risk is stated rather than solved.** The list is explicit, so an
 * attribute nobody thought of is kept, and a DevExpress release that adds a
 * content-bearing attribute widens the hole quietly. The alternative — keep only
 * what is on an allowlist — fails the other way, dropping appearance the moment the
 * vendor adds any attribute, and a chunker that silently loses style is useless for
 * the one job it has. Revisit this if a real library turns up something leaking.
 *
 * ## What it does not do
 *
 * No network, no embedding, no storage, no ranking. This produces chunks and
 * captions from a string, deterministically, and stops there.
